Unity3D is the main engine we will be using for this course. It is accessible enough for it to be a great place to start developing VR content, but it is a professional engine used by a large proportion of VR studios, which can achieve a lot of high end graphics effects.

The Unity website lets you download unity (the personal edition is free):

https://unity3d.com

One of the best things about unity is the documentation and community that will support your learning.

The "learn" section of the website contains a lot of tutorials and documentation:

https://unity3d.com/learn

The interface and essentials tutorials are a good starting point:

https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/interface-essentials

and there is a dedicated set of VR tutorials (that includes some examples that we will refer to in this course):

https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality

If there is a specific feature you need to learn about you can refer to the manual:

https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html

If none of these help there are a lot of community forums where you can ask questions of experienced unity developers (but search first, you question has probably already been answered)
